# RTB21 (Read the Bible in 2021)

This is one of my new years resolutions, so I wrote this little tool to help me keep track of what I've read and what I need to read.

**RTB21** divides the readings up by words-per-day. The first and last weeks of the year are not a full 7 days, so those will be smaller readings, the rest of the 51 weeks will be roughly the same number of words per week.

**RTB21** keeps track of your progress in your browser. When you come back to the app, it will be where you left off.

**RTB21** is mobile friendly, so it works well on your phone or tablet.
